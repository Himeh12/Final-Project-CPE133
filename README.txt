Our project is a binary practice game implemented via Vivado and the FPGA Basys 3 Board. When the bitstream is loaded onto the board, a random decimal number will be displayed on the seven segment display of the board. The user's job is to input the correct 8-bit binary representation of that decimal number to move onto the next number. As the user gets an answer correct, an LED will light up. When the user gets 3 correct, and decides to keep playing, the LEDs will reset to blank and light up accordingly as they continue to play.
